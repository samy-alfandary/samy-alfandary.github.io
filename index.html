    <p> I was born and raised in Miami, FL and my family is from Venezuela. I am a fourth-year Data Science and Business
        Administration major with a concentration in finance. I had the exciting opportunity to study abroad last
        semester in Madrid, Spain at a top business school named IE University. This past summer I did an internship at
        an
        investment management firm in Miami called <a href="https://aliyacapitalpartners.com/">Aliya Capital
            Partners</a>. Some of my responsibilities there included
        researching and analyzing investment opportunities and also managing and optimizing client portfolios. I also
        had the
        opportunity to experience the strategy consulting industry through a 6-month co-op at <a
            href="https://www.lek.com/">LEK Consulting</a> as a Case
        Team Assistant. I was involved in multiple cases in the industrials sector ranging from Vendor Due Diligence,
        Commercial Due diligence and strategy. I would describe myself as a disciplined and highly motivated individual
        that can quickly adapt to fast-paced environments and after various internships I am grateful for all the
        knowledge and experience that I have had the privilege of being exposed to.
